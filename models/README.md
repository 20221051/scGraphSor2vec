# scGraphSor2vec model

We incorporated the cor2vec methodology, capturing correlation information between
cells or genes, into the existing benchmarked weighted graph sample and aggregation (GraphSAGE)
model. This method improves the relationships and interactions within the network, enhancing the
predictive accuracy and biological relevance of the cell node classifications.
