# scGraphSor2vec model

We incorporated the cor2vec methodology, capturing correlation information between cells or genes, <br/>
into the existing benchmarked weighted graph sample and aggregation (GraphSAGE) model. <br/>

This method improves the relationships and interactions within the network, <br/>
enhancing the predictive accuracy and biological relevance of the cell node classifications.
